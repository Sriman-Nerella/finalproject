<h1>Appoint my doctor</h1>
This is a responsive webpage which I created using simple HTML and CSS languages.

This is a basic webpage which is used as an application form to fill out the required details so that based on the details submitted by the patients the respective doctor will be assigned to the patient.

The webpage can be used as an API for numerous health websites, by doing so no designer needs to create a sepearate webpage for the <strong>Patient details</strong>, they can link their databases to the response of this webpage.
